🌏 Beijing Air Quality Analysis Project - Data from 12 Stations

Hello everyone! I'm currently working on an air quality analysis project in Beijing using data from 12 different stations. This project aims to understand air quality trends, map major air pollutants, and identify factors influencing air quality at various locations.

📊 Data Used:

Data collected from 12 different stations in Beijing.
Key variables include PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3, temperature (TEMP), pressure (PRES), dew point (DEWP), rain (RAIN), and wind speed (WSPM).

🎯 Project Objectives:

Trend Analysis: Analyzing air quality trends over a specific period.
Pollutant Identification: Determining the major air pollutants that may have the greatest impact.
Influencing Factors: Investigating correlations between factors such as weather, time, and location and air quality.
Predictive Modeling: Building predictive models to estimate future air quality.

💡 Important Information:

Assumptions: This project is based on the assumption that the data used is accurate and representative.
Analysis Methodology: Analysis involves various statistical techniques and data visualizations.
Result Interpretation: Analysis results will be interpreted to provide in-depth insights into air quality in Beijing.

📈 Project Steps:

Data Understanding: Initial data exploration to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data Cleaning: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and transforming data if necessary.
Exploratory Analysis: Examining initial visualizations and data distributions for preliminary insights.
